# Cloud Foundry Rust Buildpack

[![CF Slack](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.slack.com) Join us on Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/buildpacks/)

A Cloud Foundry [buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) for Rust based apps.

### Buildpack User Documentation

Official buildpack documentation can be found at [go buildpack docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/go/index.html).

### Building the Buildpack

To build this buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

1. Source the .envrc file in the buildpack directory.

   ```bash
   source .envrc
   ```
   To simplify the process in the future, install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which will automatically source .envrc when you change directories.

1. Install buildpack-packager

    ```bash
    (cd src/go/vendor/github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/packager/buildpack-packager && go install)
    ```

1. Build the buildpack

    ```bash
    buildpack-packager build [ --cached=(true|false) ]
    ```

1. Use in Cloud Foundry

   Upload the buildpack to your Cloud Foundry and optionally specify it by name

    ```bash
    cf create-buildpack [BUILDPACK_NAME] [BUILDPACK_ZIP_FILE_PATH] 1
    cf push my_app [-b BUILDPACK_NAME]
    ```

### Testing

Buildpacks use the [Cutlass](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/cutlass) framework for running integration tests.

To test this buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

1. Source the .envrc file in the buildpack directory.

   ```bash
   source .envrc
   ```
   To simplify the process in the future, install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which will automatically source .envrc when you change directories.

1. Run unit tests

    ```bash
    ./scripts/unit.sh
    ```

1. Run integration tests

    ```bash
    ./scripts/integration.sh
    ```
